## Course Description

The Energy Forum is a lecture series offered in the spring semester of
each year. Its goal is to expose students to current ideas and
activities in the energy field, support interaction with the
professional community, find out about the work some of our alumni are
doing. It is my hope that the course will expose you to topics,
speakers, careers and firms that you find interesting and worth
pursuing. Energy Forum sessions typically feature a guest speaker making
a one-hour presentation on an energy-related topic, followed by a
question-and-answer period. Forum presentations at the ETC are open to
members of the SSU community and the general public if space permits;
Although none are currently scheduled, any field trips are for enrolled
students only.

## Learning Objectives

- Exposure to professional opportunities
- Exposure to new technologies and business models
- Development of professional communication skills

## Course Requirements

ENSP majors or minors, junior- or senior-level standing.

## Grading

This course is graded on a Credit/No Credit basis.  To receive credit, you must:

1. Attend at least 12 of 13 Forum meetings, or substitute an additional
Outside Forum (see below) for any missed class. An attendance sheet will
be circulated during each session; it is your responsibility to sign it.

2. Write two Reaction Papers of 500-1000 words. A Reaction Paper should
address the major lessons learned from a presentation, how these relate
to your academic and professional experience and goals, and any
questions you have in light of the presentation. Reaction papers are due
prior to the next class. All reaction papers must submitted by May 1st.
To receive credit, a Reaction Paper must be written in clear English,
typewritten, edited and proofread (you are encouraged to seek help at
SSU’s Writing Center if necessary). Reaction Papers with misspellings,
grammatical errors, or other unprofessional presentation sufficient to
distract from the content will be rejected.

3. Attend at least one “Outside Forum” off campus. Opportunities for
outside forums include seminars, workshops, conferences, colloquia, or
other professional gatherings. You may also conduct an Informational
Interview with a professional in the energy field about their work.
Write up this outside experience as the THIRD reaction paper due before
finals week. Some Outside Forum opportunities will be announced during
the semester, but you are encouraged to do your own research early in
the semester. The essential criteria for an event to qualify as an
“Outside Forum” are that it is must relate to the subject of energy
technology or policy, and that it must involve a presentation at a
professional or collegiate level of sophistication. No web based
presentations or trainings will qualify unless approved in advance and
represents an outstanding learning opportunity. When in doubt, you are
welcome to check with me if a particular event qualifies.

## Agreements

- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and interactions.

- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  Using devices for social networks or other
uses during class time is strongly discouraged.

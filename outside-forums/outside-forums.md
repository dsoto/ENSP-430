## Bayonne Gasoline Strikes

- This study looks at the connection between two deadly strikes in
  Bayonne, NJ and the construction of the nation's first garden-style
  apartment complex as housing for the employees of Standard Oil. The
  strikes drew national attention, drawing in prominent labor organizers
  from the IWW and professional strikebreakers. The socialist, John
  Reed, author of Ten Days the Shook the World, reported on the strike
  for The New York Tribune. The violent strikes launched a crusade
  within Standard to find a new model of labor relations management as
  an alternative to the company's long-standing, anti-union policies.
  The construction of employee housing was seen not just as a way to
  cool labor hostilities, but to education and civilize the immigrant
  working class.
